The thought strand appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise stationary.</p><p>If you cast this spell while concentrating on a spell or an ability that allows you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as <i>detect thoughts</i> or <i>modify memory</i>), you can transform the thoughts or memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought strand.</p><p>Casting this spell while holding a thought strand allows you to instantly receive whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting <i>detect thoughts</i> on the strand has the same effect.)</p>",
