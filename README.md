#How it Works
After opening the web page select your sourcebooks you wish to use.
Changing your sourcebooks repopulates the table and will result in a loss of any previously selected data.

You can then go through the provided table and select which spells you wish to have in your spellbook.

Once all are selected that you wish to have, click the "Create Spellbook" button. Which will open a new web page with your spells on it. Download or print this webpage to have your spell book.
